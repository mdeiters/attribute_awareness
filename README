AttributeAwareness
=====================

This plugin allows you a DRY way to define descriptions of your model's attributes in the model itself instead of sprinkle all over the views. Additionally it is aware of validations that are defined on a model.

Example
=======

class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base
  describe_attributes :name => 'Some dog's name, typically Fido or Spot'
  validates_presence_of :age
end

Dog.new.description_for(:name) #=> 'Some dog's name, typically Fido or Spot'
Dog.new.is_required?(:age) #=> true
